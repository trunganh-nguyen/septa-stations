## Project and Data information

[UnlockedMaps](https://unlockedmaps.com/) (originally UnlockPhilly) maps urban rail transit with accessibility as the focus, showing real-time elevator status to help those relying on elevators, such as wheelchair users, with their commute. 

Elevator status is fetched from transit authorities’ websites via API calls.

This preliminary exploration focuses on recorded outage data for train lines operated by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in the Greater Philadelphia area in the 24-month period from March 2017 - March 2019.

## Questions and Significance
 
- How accessible are stations around Philadelphia?
- How often are elevators at those stations out of service?

- Many people depend on working, accessible stations to get around
- Analysis of recorded outages helps advocacy efforts:
  - Make more stations and lines accessible
  - Identify pressure points—stations that need more maintenance and upkeep

Plots and R code the plots can be found in this repository.
